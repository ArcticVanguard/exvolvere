Ability descriptions:
Creep - passive ability, makes the creature harder to detect by enemies that rely
Overpower - passive ability, enemies affected by basic attacks are unable to flee for one turn
Pierce - basic piercing attack, does reduced damage but ignores enemy armor
Roar - reduces aggression for enemies below a given aggro stat, raises it for those above
Slash - does damage to the three squares directly in front of the player. Does higher than average damage but is more heavily affected by enemy armor
Stealth - inflicts the stealth status on self until turned off
Strike - basic damaging attack, no special effects
Sunder - attack that does no damage but halves enemy armor for some time
Taunt - increases aggression for all nearby enemies
Whirlwind - does good damage to all enemies in the 8 tiles surrounding the creature, but increases the creature's dizziness counter by 8

Status effects:
Asleep - a creature that is asleep is unable to act for a certain period, but regenerates health at an increased rate during this time. Most creatures suffer a movement and damage penalty the turn that they wake up
Dizzy - turning in place increments a dizziness counter, which (when a certain threshold is exceeded) causes the creature to become dizzy. Dizzy creatures are unable to move or attack for one turn
Frenzy - doing more damage per attack, but also taking more damage
Taunted - a taunted creature is forced to attack the target that taunted it for a period of time
Winded - some attacks inflict the winded effect, which stuns the player for one turn (make this a rare effect? Unfun mechanic, potential instant loss if handled wrong)
